# Yelp-Reviews
In this project, Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies will be used to analyze Yelp reviews data. In this project, I learnt the basics of Natural Language Processing and applied the Natural Language Toolkit or Nltk for short to perform tokenization, feature extraction using Count Vectorizer, difference between Likelihood, prior probability and marginal likelihood. I also trained a Na√Øve Bayes classifier model using scikit learn and develop a function in python in order to apply it to the Pandas Data Frame
